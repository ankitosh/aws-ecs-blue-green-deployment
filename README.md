####What is Canary Deployment ?

- By keeping canary traffic small and the selection random, most users are not adversely affected at any time by potential bugs in the new version, and no single user is adversely affected all the time.
- After the test metrics pass your requirements, you can promote the canary release to the production release and disable the canary from the deployment. This makes the new features available in the production stage.
